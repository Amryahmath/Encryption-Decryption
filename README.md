# Encryption-Decryption Program in Python

This repository contains a Python program that provides simple and secure encryption and decryption functionality. The program demonstrates basic concepts of cryptography and is suitable for educational purposes or small-scale secure data handling.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Converts plaintext into ciphertext using a secret key.
- **Decryption**: Converts ciphertext back into readable plaintext using the same key.
- **Symmetric Key Encryption**: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line-based interaction for ease of use.
- **Extensibility**: Easily adaptable to incorporate more advanced cryptographic algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Implemented using Python's standard libraries and optional external libraries like `cryptography` or `Fernet` for enhanced security.
- **Randomized Keys (optional)**: Supports generating strong random keys for securing data.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for incorrect inputs or key mismatches.

## How It Works
1. **Encryption**: 
   - Input: Plaintext and a secret key.
   - Output: Ciphertext (encrypted text).
   - Example: "Hello" → "U2FsdGVkX1+...".
   
2. **Decryption**: 
   - Input: Ciphertext and the same secret key used for encryption.
   - Output: Original plaintext.
   - Example: "U2FsdGVkX1+..." → "Hello".

3. **Choice of Algorithm**:
   - Default: XOR-based or simple substitution (for demonstration).
   - Advanced: AES or DES using external libraries for real-world security.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-decryption-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd encryption-decryption-python
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if using external libraries):
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python encryption_decryption.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt data.

## Use Cases
- Secure data storage.
- Protected communication.
- Learning the basics of cryptography.
